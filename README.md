# Data-Wrangling-with-OpenStreetMap

For this project, I have downloaded sample size of Phoenix metropolitan area, predominantly Tempe, AZ and as I am doing my Masters in CS at Arizona State University. Selecting Tempe city helped me to validate the data using my personal knowledge of the area.  Here's the link to the Overpass API for downloading the OSM of the region.

Below is the map screenshot of OSM :
